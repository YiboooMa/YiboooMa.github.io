## Research Interests

- Network Digital Twins
- Optimization of Energy Consumption in 5G Networks
- Machine Learning for Networks

My research envolves **measurement, simulation, and optimization of networked systems**, making advanced algorithms deployable in real-world networks. I specialize in **Network Digital Twin technology** to enhance the performance and sustainability of **large-scale networked systems**, such as mobile networks and geo-distributed data centers. I analyze real-time operational data, simulate system dynamics, and develop optimization algorithms to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions. Additionally, I am deeply interested in **applying machine learning techniques to enhance network performance**.

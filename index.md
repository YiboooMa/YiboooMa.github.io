Here is **Yibo Ma (é©¬ç¾©æ³¢)**.<br>

In September 2025, I will start my Ph.D. in the [**Networked Systems (NetSys) Group**](https://netsys.inf.ed.ac.uk/) at the University of Edinburgh, supervised by [**Prof. Mahesh K. Marina**](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mmarina/). I earned my M.S. degree at Tsinghua University under the guidance of [**Prof. Yong Li**](https://fi.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/~liyong/), with my thesis receiving the Outstanding Thesis Award. Prior to that, I completed my B.S. degree at Tongji University, advised by [**Prof. Yaobao Yin**](https://mefaculty.tongji.edu.cn/info/1296/3241.htm).

I am passionate about all aspects of **Networking and Artificial Intelligence**, and I am currently preparing to go to the Edinburgh for my Ph.D. studies. If you are interested in my research or potential collaborations, I am always open to discussion and new ideas. Feel free to reach out to me at <u>mayibo2hyh [at] gmail.com</u>.

<!-- <img src="./images/AboutMe.png" width="200" /> -->

Here is **Yibo Ma (马義波)**.<br>

Starting in September 2025, I will begin my Ph.D. journey at the School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh, as a member of the [Networked Systems (NetSys) Group](https://netsys.inf.ed.ac.uk/), supervised by [Prof. Mahesh K. Marina](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mmarina/). I earned my M.S. degree at Tsinghua University under the guidance of [Prof. Yong Li](https://fi.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/~liyong/), where my thesis received the Outstanding Thesis Award. Before that, I completed my B.S. degree at Tongji University, advised by [Prof. Yaobao Yin](https://mefaculty.tongji.edu.cn/info/1296/3241.htm).

I am passionate about all aspects of Networking and Artificial Intelligence, and I am currently preparing to relocate to the United Kingdom for my Ph.D. studies. If you are interested in my research or potential collaborations, I am always open to discussion and new ideas. Feel free to reach out to me at mayibo2hyh [at] gmail.com.

Here is my Resume: [Resume](./file/CV-Yibo_Ma.pdf)

## Research Interests

- Network Digital Twinning
- Optimization of Energy Efficiency in Mobile Networks
- Data-driven and AI-based Approaches for Networking

My research envolves **measurement, simulation, and optimization of networked systems**, making advanced algorithms deployable in real-world networks. I specialize in **Network Digital Twin technology** to enhance the performance and sustainability of **large-scale networked systems**, such as mobile networks and geo-distributed data centers. I analyze real-time operational data, simulate system dynamics, and develop optimization algorithms to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions. Additionally, I am deeply interested in **applying machine learning techniques to enhance network performance**.

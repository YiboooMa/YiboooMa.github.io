<!-- <img src="./images/AboutMe.png" width="200" /> -->

Here is **Yibo Ma (é©¬ç¾©æ³¢)**.<br>

I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the [**UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in Machine Learning Systems (MLSys CDT)**](https://mlsystems.uk) at the University of Edinburgh, supervised by [**Prof. Mahesh K. Marina**](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mmarina/) and [**Prof. Amos Storkey**](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/amos/). I am also a member of the [**Networked Systems (NetSys) Group**](https://netsys.inf.ed.ac.uk/). My research lies at the intersection of **Networking and ML Systems**, with a focus on building intelligent, efficient, and robust networked systems.

Previously, I obtained my M.S. degree from Tsinghua University under the supervision of [**Prof. Yong Li**](https://fi.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/~liyong/), where my thesis was awarded the Outstanding Thesis Award. I earned my B.S. degree from Tongji University, advised by [**Prof. Yaobao Yin**](https://mefaculty.tongji.edu.cn/info/1296/3241.htm).

I am always open to discussions and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me at <u>mayibo2hyh [at] gmail.com</u>.

## Research Interests

- Network Digital Twinning
- Optimization of Energy Efficiency in Mobile Networks
- Data-driven and AI-based Approaches for Networking

My research envolves **measurement, simulation, and optimization of networked systems**. I analyze real-time operational data, simulate system dynamics, and develop optimization algorithms to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions. I specialize in **Network Digital Twin technology** to enhance the performance and sustainability of **large-scale networked systems**, such as mobile networks and geo-distributed data centers.

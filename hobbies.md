# Hobbies

I have a wide range of hobbies that reflect my diverse interests and passion for a balanced life. I enjoy playing the guitar, swimming, table tennis, calligraphy, running, and practicing the nunchaku. My love for reading spans a wide variety of genres, keeping my mind constantly engaged.

Due to my demanding research work, I’ve had to temporarily set aside some of these activities. However, I continue to keep up with guitar, swimming, and reading as they help me maintain both physical and mental well-being.

If you share a love for a fulfilling life beyond the busy work routine, feel free to reach out and let’s connect!

## Swimming

<br>I’m still a newcomer to swimming, and I enjoy the relaxation that breaststroke offers in the water, but I’m also learning the more graceful freestyle.

## Guitar

<br>I developed a passion for guitar performance starting from middle school. Playing and singing pop songs, as well as fingerstyle playing, are my specialties. I achieved the China Guitar Grade 10 (the highest level of the China Musician Association Guitar Proficiency Examination, which is roughly equivalent to ABRSM Grade 8 in difficulty). The band I organized during my undergraduate years was well-loved both on and off campus. I hope to continue connecting with people who share a love for music.


## Past Hobbies

I previously enjoyed long-distance running, [vlog making](https://space.bilibili.com/594030035), and computer game developing/playing. However, I have no time to do any of these things recently.

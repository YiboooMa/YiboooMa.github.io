## Ongoing Project

- **Optimization of Large-Scale Geo-Distributed Data Centers: Bandwidth Utilization and Sustainability** (Supervised by [Prof. Yong Li](https://fi.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/~liyong/))

> This project focuses on optimizing **large-scale, geo-distributed data centers** to address **bandwidth utilization** and **sustainability** challenges, especially under conditions of the increased number of task. Our goal is to minimize remote access between data centers by strategically coordinating task computation and data placement, considering resource constraints and real-time task requirements. The optimization approach integrates city-level power supply factors and cross-regional task scheduling, aiming to reduce carbon emissions associated with data center operations. By dynamically managing task distribution and resource allocation, this project seeks to achieve a balance between performance efficiency and environmental sustainability.

- **A World Model-Based Framework for Energy Optimization in Mobile Networks** (Supervised by [Prof. Yong Li](https://fi.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/~liyong/))

> We propose a framework where a world model, grounded in fundamental model for mobile networks, empowers a reinforcement learning (RL) agent with proactive state input and multi-step planning capability. Specifically, the world model predicts cell-level user number and traffic volume, while a Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (TGCN) captures the spatiotemporal features of cells. These are fed into the RL agent for a two-stage decision process: determining the sleep status of base stations, and orchestrating service offloading. The agent's actions interact with the world model to simulate changes in energy consumption and network performance, while checking for violations of real-world network constraints. Multi-step rollout is used to gather long-term returns for training the agent.
